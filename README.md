Sketch example on how to make chinese Arduino UNO R3 + ESP8266 board to communicate with its ESP module.<br />
The purpose of this repo is to show how can we make our program stored on ATMega328 have access to the Internet and/or provide its state to the Internel with ability to operate with that state from external devices.

The code from `WiFi_AT` folder goes to ATMega, the code from `WiFi_ESP` goes to ESP8266.
